        <h4 class="mb-4">Hard to Beat. Easy to Own.</h4>
        <p class="mb-0">Brandt’s all-new Work Ready heavy haul trailers are purpose-built to be easier to own, easier to operate, and safer than any other trailer on the road. They achieve this with innovative features, like our patent-pending booster stability system. This unique system locks the booster axle when backing up or travelling over 60km/h for safer, easier handling. And, Brandt trailers are built to outlast the competition. These durable designs incorporate premium-quality components and the industry’s toughest powder-coat finish, so you can count on them to pull through the toughest conditions and come back for more. In fact, we confidently back them with an industry-leading 1-year bumper-to-bumper warranty on all components.</p>
