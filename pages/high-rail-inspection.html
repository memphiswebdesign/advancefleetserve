            <p class="mb-3">Involves the specialized maintenance and repair of "hi-rail" vehicles, which are trucks or utility vehicles equipped with special gear to operate on both roadways and railway tracks. Because these vehicles face the dual stresses of road and rail travel, servicing is critical for safety, regulatory compliance, and operational reliability. The process includes routine inspections, hydraulic and rail gear maintenance, and general vehicle upkeep.</p>

                <li>Federal Railroad Administration (FRA): In the U.S., the FRA mandates annual safety inspections of the rail gear on all hi-rail vehicles.</li>

                <li><strong>Rail gear system:</strong> This is the most crucial component and requires constant attention.</li>
                <ul class="ml-4 mb-2">
                    <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Checks for wear and tear, including flange thickness, cracks, and flat spots on the rail wheels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The rail gear must be properly aligned to the track gauge to prevent uneven wear and derailment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hydraulics:</strong> Inspections check the lifting mechanisms, fluid levels, and hoses for leaks, especially in cold weather, which can cause fluid to freeze.</li>

            <ul class="markers">
                <li><strong>Braking system:</strong> Hi-rail vehicles have a dual braking system for road and rail operation. Both must be regularly inspected for performance and functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Engine and drivetrain:</strong> Operators must maintain the engine and transmission, including fluid changes and filter replacements, to ensure the vehicle can handle the demands of rail travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrical systems:</strong> The complex electrical systems that operate signaling, safety lights, and control mechanisms must be inspected for damaged wiring or other issues caused by track vibrations.</li>
                <li><strong>Undercarriage:</strong> Because of exposure to dirt, moisture, and debris on the tracks, technicians must check the chassis for rust, corrosion, and structural damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety features:</strong> Daily inspections should verify that warning lights, horns, backup alarms, and interlock systems are all functioning properly.</li>
